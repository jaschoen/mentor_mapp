                        Facilitation of Payments. All Charges are facilitated through a third-party payment processing service (e.g., Stripe, Inc., or Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc.). Kenshotree may replace its third-party payment processing services without notice to you. Charges shall only be made through the Kenshotree Platform. Cash payments are strictly prohibited.

                        No Refunds. Charges are assessed immediately upon confirmation of a coaching contract through your authorized payment method. All Charges are non-refundable.

                        Credit Card Authorization. Upon addition of a new payment method or each coaching request, Kenshotree may seek authorization of your selected payment method to verify your payment method, ensure the coaching cost will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or check card. We cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank.

Kenshotree will process all payments due to you through its third party payments processor. You acknowledge and agree that such amounts shall not include any interest and will be net of any amounts that we are required to withhold by law. Kenshotree reserves the right to withhold all or a portion of Coaching Fees if it believes that you have attempted to defraud or abuse Kenshotree or Kenshotree’s payment systems.

The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect, except as modified by this section. Judgment of the arbitration award may be entered into any court having jurisdiction thereof.

If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration you and Kenshotree each waive any right to a jury trial. Both parties agree that either may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. You and Kenshotree irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Chicago, Illinois and the Northern District of Illinois in connection with any litigation. Both parties waive any objection based on lack of personal jurisdiction, place of residence, improper venue or forum non conveniens in any such action. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT YOU ARE CONSENTING TO ARBITRATION AND WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS.

We may use demographic information to tailor the Kenshotree Platform and communications to Your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers Your identity). One of the reasons We may do this is to increase the likelihood that Our advertisers’ goods and services will appeal to You as a user of the Kenshotree Platform. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., We do not tell advertisers which particular Kenshotree Users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When You respond to an advertisement, however, We ask You to remember that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and You decide to give the advertiser Your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify You as being a member of that demographic group.
